# google-homepage

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

An attempt to re-create the Google homepage (in appearance, not in functionality)
to demonstrate basic HTML and CSS skills. I will try to do as much as I can on my
own but may end up using the web inspector on the browser to figure out some of it
if I get stuck.
